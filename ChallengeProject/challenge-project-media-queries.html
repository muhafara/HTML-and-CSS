        The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types. Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on. Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.
